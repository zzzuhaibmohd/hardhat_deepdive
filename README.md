# hardhat_deepdive

Thanks to @rodrigoherrerai and his tutorial for learning harhat project - https://betterprogramming.pub/the-complete-hands-on-hardhat-tutorial-9e23728fc8a4

Project 1 -> I learnt how to use write unit test cases. Hardhat provides a local network for faster testing of our unit test cases like Transfering Funds, Checking Balances, Verifying Authorizations etc.,

Project 2 -> Shows us how to for the mainnet at a particular block number. This skill can come in helpful when creating a PoC's for a possible security vulnerability.

Project 3 -> It is running a local hardhat node with predefined accounts and interacting with the smart contract via javascript.
